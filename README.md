## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11** *(tested and compatible)*
- **OpenCV** – for video capture and image processing
- **MediaPipe** – for real-time hand tracking
- **PyAutoGUI** (optional) – to simulate keyboard or mouse actions
- **Pyttsx3** (optional) – for text-to-speech voice feedback
FFmpeg should be installed also ! 

## 📦 Required Libraries

Make sure you're using **Python 3.11**, as the code may not run correctly on newer versions due to MediaPipe compatibility issues.

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui pyttsx3 numpy
